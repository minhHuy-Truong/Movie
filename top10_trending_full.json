Black Phone 2 only in theaters October 17.\n\n\n-\nFour years ago, 13-year-old Finn killed his abductor and escaped, becoming the sole survivor of The Grabber. But true evil transcends death … and the phone is ringing again. \n\nFour-time Academy Award® nominee Ethan Hawke returns to the most sinister role of his career as The Grabber seeks vengeance on Finn (Mason Thames) from beyond the grave by menacing Finn’s younger sister, Gwen (Madeleine McGraw). \n\nAs Finn, now 17, struggles with life after his captivity, the headstrong 15-year-old Gwen begins receiving calls in her dreams from the black phone and seeing disturbing visions of three boys being stalked at a winter camp known as Alpine Lake. \n\nDetermined to solve the mystery and end the torment for both her and her brother, Gwen persuades Finn to visit the camp during a winter storm. There, she uncovers a shattering intersection between The Grabber and her own family’s history. Together, she and Finn must confront a killer who has grown more powerful in death and more significant to them than either could imagine.\n\nFrom returning visionary writer-director Scott Derrickson, Black Phone 2 is written again by Derrickson & C. Robert Cargill, based on characters created by Joe Hill. The film is produced by Jason Blum, Derrickson and Cargill. The executive producers are Adam Hendricks and Ryan Turek.\n\nThe cast includes Oscar® nominee Demián Bichir (The Nun, A Better Life) as the supervisor of the camp, Arianna Rivas (A Working Man) as his niece, Miguel Mora (The Black Phone) as the brother of one of The Grabber’s victims, and Jeremy Davies, returning as Finn and Gwen’s father, Terrence. Other new cast members include Maev Beaty (Beau is Afraid) and Graham Abbey (Under the Banner of Heaven). \n\nUniversal Pictures and Blumhouse’s horror phenomenon The Black Phone, released in 2022, received widespread critical acclaim and earned more than $160 million.\n\n\nFollow Black Phone on socials:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/blackphonemovie/ \nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheBlackPhoneMovie\nwww.blackphonemovie.com \n\nFind Universal Pictures on Instagram at https://www.instagram.com/universalpictures/ \nFollow Universal Pictures on X at https://www.twitter.com/universalpictures/ \nFollow Universal Pictures on Facebook at: https://facebook.com/UniversalPictures \nhttps://www.universalpictures.com/",

            "description": "Watch the brand-new trailer for Tron: Ares and experience it in theaters, filmed for IMAX, October 10.\n \nTron: Ares follows a highly sophisticated Program, Ares, who is sent from the digital world into the real world on a dangerous mission, marking humankind’s first encounter with A.I. beings. The feature film is directed by Joachim Rønning and stars Jared Leto, Greta Lee, Evan Peters, Hasan Minhaj, Jodie Turner-Smith, Arturo Castro, Cameron Monaghan, with Gillian Anderson, and Jeff Bridges. Sean Bailey, Jeffrey Silver, Justin Springer, Jared Leto, Emma Ludbrook and Steven Lisberger are the producers, with Russell Allen serving as executive producer.\n\nGrammy®-award winning rock band Nine Inch Nails composed the score for “Tron: Ares,” and today, the band dropped \"As Alive As You Need Me To Be\" —the soundtrack album’s first single and the first official music from the band in five years. Listen to \"As Alive As You Need Me To Be” and view the visualizer: https://nineinchnails.lnk.to/AAAYNMTB. The track is featured in the new trailer for “Tron: Ares.”\n \n“Tron: Ares (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack),” featuring all original music by Nine Inch Nails, will be released on September 19 via Interscope Records. The release marks the first-ever film score by the pioneering band, although bandmates Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross have composed 20 scores under their own names, winning two Oscars®, three Golden Globes®, a GRAMMY® and an Emmy® in the process.\n \nALBUM: https://NineInchNails.lnk.to/TRONAres\nSINGLE: https://NineInchNails.lnk.to/AAAYNMTB\nLYRIC VIDEO: https://youtu.be/-Sj-FmI5JfA\n\n► SUBSCRIBE to the channel to get notified when new Disney videos are posted: https://www.youtube.com/user/DisneysShows?sub_confirmation=1\n\n► SUBSCRIBE to Disney+ to stream all of your favorite Disney shows and movies: https://www.disneyplus.com/\n\nFollow on social media to get the latest news and announcements from Disney:\n\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@disney\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/disney/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/Disney/\nX: https://x.com/disney\nWebsite: https://www.disney.com/\n\nExperience more stories by subscribing: \n\n/ @marvel\n/ @StarWars\n/ @pixar\n/ @disneyplus",

              "description": "Watch the brand-new trailer for Tron: Ares and experience it in theaters, filmed for IMAX, October 10.\n \nTron: Ares follows a highly sophisticated Program, Ares, who is sent from the digital world into the real world on a dangerous mission, marking humankind’s first encounter with A.I. beings. The feature film is directed by Joachim Rønning and stars Jared Leto, Greta Lee, Evan Peters, Hasan Minhaj, Jodie Turner-Smith, Arturo Castro, Cameron Monaghan, with Gillian Anderson, and Jeff Bridges. Sean Bailey, Jeffrey Silver, Justin Springer, Jared Leto, Emma Ludbrook and Steven Lisberger are the producers, with Russell Allen serving as executive producer.\n\nGrammy®-award winning rock band Nine Inch Nails composed the score for “Tron: Ares,” and today, the band dropped \"As Alive As You Need Me To Be\" —the soundtrack album’s first single and the first official music from the band in five years. Listen to \"As Alive As You Need Me To Be” and view the visualizer: https://nineinchnails.lnk.to/AAAYNMTB. The track is featured in the new trailer for “Tron: Ares.”\n \n“Tron: Ares (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack),” featuring all original music by Nine Inch Nails, will be released on September 19 via Interscope Records. The release marks the first-ever film score by the pioneering band, although bandmates Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross have composed 20 scores under their own names, winning two Oscars®, three Golden Globes®, a GRAMMY® and an Emmy® in the process.\n \nALBUM: https://NineInchNails.lnk.to/TRONAres\nSINGLE: https://NineInchNails.lnk.to/AAAYNMTB\nLYRIC VIDEO: https://youtu.be/-Sj-FmI5JfA\n\n► SUBSCRIBE to the channel to get notified when new Disney videos are posted: https://www.youtube.com/user/DisneysShows?sub_confirmation=1\n\n► SUBSCRIBE to Disney+ to stream all of your favorite Disney shows and movies: https://www.disneyplus.com/\n\nFollow on social media to get the latest news and announcements from Disney:\n\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@disney\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/disney/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/Disney/\nX: https://x.com/disney\nWebsite: https://www.disney.com/\n\nExperience more stories by subscribing: \n\n/ @marvel\n/ @StarWars\n/ @pixar\n/ @disneyplus"
