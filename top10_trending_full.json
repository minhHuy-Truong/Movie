Black Phone 2 only in theaters October 17.\n\n\n-\nFour years ago, 13-year-old Finn killed his abductor and escaped, becoming the sole survivor of The Grabber. But true evil transcends death … and the phone is ringing again. \n\nFour-time Academy Award® nominee Ethan Hawke returns to the most sinister role of his career as The Grabber seeks vengeance on Finn (Mason Thames) from beyond the grave by menacing Finn’s younger sister, Gwen (Madeleine McGraw). \n\nAs Finn, now 17, struggles with life after his captivity, the headstrong 15-year-old Gwen begins receiving calls in her dreams from the black phone and seeing disturbing visions of three boys being stalked at a winter camp known as Alpine Lake. \n\nDetermined to solve the mystery and end the torment for both her and her brother, Gwen persuades Finn to visit the camp during a winter storm. There, she uncovers a shattering intersection between The Grabber and her own family’s history. Together, she and Finn must confront a killer who has grown more powerful in death and more significant to them than either could imagine.\n\nFrom returning visionary writer-director Scott Derrickson, Black Phone 2 is written again by Derrickson & C. Robert Cargill, based on characters created by Joe Hill. The film is produced by Jason Blum, Derrickson and Cargill. The executive producers are Adam Hendricks and Ryan Turek.\n\nThe cast includes Oscar® nominee Demián Bichir (The Nun, A Better Life) as the supervisor of the camp, Arianna Rivas (A Working Man) as his niece, Miguel Mora (The Black Phone) as the brother of one of The Grabber’s victims, and Jeremy Davies, returning as Finn and Gwen’s father, Terrence. Other new cast members include Maev Beaty (Beau is Afraid) and Graham Abbey (Under the Banner of Heaven). \n\nUniversal Pictures and Blumhouse’s horror phenomenon The Black Phone, released in 2022, received widespread critical acclaim and earned more than $160 million.\n\n\nFollow Black Phone on socials:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/blackphonemovie/ \nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheBlackPhoneMovie\nwww.blackphonemovie.com \n\nFind Universal Pictures on Instagram at https://www.instagram.com/universalpictures/ \nFollow Universal Pictures on X at https://www.twitter.com/universalpictures/ \nFollow Universal Pictures on Facebook at: https://facebook.com/UniversalPictures \nhttps://www.universalpictures.com/",

            "description": "Witcher prequel, fantasy heist, Netflix original—The Rats: A Witcher Tale delivers a gritty, adrenaline-charged origin story that expands the Witcher universe with raw intensity and emotional depth. Set in the war-ravaged Continent, this 2025 special follows a gang of young outlaws—Iskra, Mistle, Reef, Asse, Orla, Kayleigh, and Giselher—as they plot a daring heist against a powerful crime syndicate. Directed by Mairzee Almas and written by Haily Hall, the film trades monster-hunting for street-level rebellion, blending medieval grime with punk energy. With standout performances, especially from Christelle Elwin as Mistle, and a brutal, fast-paced narrative, the story explores trauma, loyalty, and survival in a collapsing world. Cinematography by Trevor Michael Brown captures the chaos with handheld urgency, while Dolph Lundgren’s Brehen adds a morally complex layer to the gang’s journey. Released as a surprise drop on Netflix, this 82-minute special ties directly into The Witcher Season 4, offering fans a deeper look at the Rats’ fractured brotherhood and their tragic descent. It’s a must-watch for Witcher fans craving character-driven storytelling, emotional stakes, and a fresh perspective on the Continent’s darkest corners.\n\n⚠️ Disclaimer : KBM ReView is a Cinematic Sanctuary for Global Cinephiles.
